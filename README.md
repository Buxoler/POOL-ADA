Cardano ADA Staking Pool

A truly decentralized staking pool with a hybrid solution implementing a block producer node in a basement server (powered with renewable energy) and the relay nodes on a data center. 

Hosted in Switzerland and operated by a cool vegan software engineer. 

Thank you for your trust and for joining the blockchain revolution!
