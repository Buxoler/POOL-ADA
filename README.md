# ADA-Staking
Cardano (ADA) Staking Pool

A truly decentralized staking pool with a hybrid solution implementing a block producer and a backup relay on a data center and a main relay node in a basement server (powered with renewable energy). 

Hosted in Switzerland and Germany and operated by a cool vegan software engineer. 

GranADA monthly helps refugee families in countries with humanitarian crisis by contributing to the World Food Programm
